# Hi I'm Mauricio :)

Hello everyone, I am a helpful software engineer currently working in the Network Graphics industry. <br>
I only write C# code, but I really like TS. I am trying to get into Python and ML, but I still have a long way to go. <br>
In the past, I worked in banks and stock brokers. <br>
<br>
For now, I am only maintaining this repository:  <a href="https://github.com/Mauriciog87/MyApiBoilerPlate">MyBoilerPlate</a>
